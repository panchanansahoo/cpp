====== 2. decltype ======
Created Monday 18 May 2020

* Very simple, this is like a copy constructor. But it does not initialize values, it initializes only the **data type**.
* **decltype** does **not **call the function, while **auto **would need to do that.
* It can be used with literals, too. Good for experimenting, without an ide.
