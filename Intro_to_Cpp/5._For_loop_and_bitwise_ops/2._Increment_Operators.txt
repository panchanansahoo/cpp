====== 2. Increment Operators ======
Created Tuesday 22 October 2019

These are shortcuts for x = x + 1, with post and pre to make good use of them.
* pre, increases 1st and does in memory.
* post, increases after giving old value.
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2989704/order-of-operations-for-pre-increment-and-post-increment-in-a-function-argument
The statement after the two will have the same value; 
* the +=, *=, -=, [[/=.]] No pre or post in this case.
* Precedence and associativity

Associativity is used only when two operators of the same operator

Caveat: No need to remember the table, use brackets for simplicity.
* **You know it, be confident.**
