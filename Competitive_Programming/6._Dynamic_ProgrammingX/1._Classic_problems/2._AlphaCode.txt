====== 2. AlphaCode ======
Created Tuesday 30 June 2020

Very simple:
1. f(n) = the number of codes for an array of length n(starting from the head)
2. f(1223) = f(223) + f(23), because 12 can also be treated an individual
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="True"
We calculate values for only the arrays of increasing length. Then, we start adding
}}}
