====== 4. Grundy Numbers ======
Created Sunday 02 August 2020

Mex - Minimum Excludent Set.
For numbers, it is the smallest non-negative number which is absent.
mex{0,1} = {2}
mex{1,2,3} = {0}
mex{0,1, 3} = {2}

* Grundy numbers is very important w.r.t game theory.
* Grundy(n) = mex{Grundy(p1), Grundy(p2)...}
* Grundy(0) = 0, the final position.
