====== 2. Game of Nim ======
Created Sunday 02 August 2020

* Rule - Any player can remove any number of stones from a pile.
* Loser - The first person who has no stones to remove loses.

* Nimsum = XOR of all the stones in the piles, e.g 3 ^ 4 ^ 5.

Theorem of Nim:
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="True"
if(nimsum==0)
	player 1 loses;
else
	player 1 wins;
// assuming both are playing optimally
}}}
