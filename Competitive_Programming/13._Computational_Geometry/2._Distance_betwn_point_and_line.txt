====== 2. Distance betwn point and line ======
Created Thursday 20 August 2020

* Point to line: AB to C = ABxAC/|AB| = (area of triangle)/base

* Line segment to point: Find nearby point(using dot product, obtuse-acute)
	Try both AB.AC and AB.BC, if anyone is negative, then find using cartesian distance.
	Else(both + ve) find the perpendicular distance using the area formula.
