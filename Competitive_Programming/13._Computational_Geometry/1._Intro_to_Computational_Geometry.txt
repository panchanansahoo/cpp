====== 1. Intro to Computational Geometry ======
Created Thursday 20 August 2020

* We use elementary geometry to solve problems here.
* Vector concepts are used here, like products(dot and cross), magnitudes, displacement etc.
* Dot product (x_{1}, y_{1}), (x_{2}, y_{2}) = x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2} = |a|*|b|*cos(Î¸)
* Cross product - Area of triangle(AxB/2), Area of parallelogram(AxB)
