====== 3. Area of a polygon ======
Created Thursday 20 August 2020

**Triangulation method**
* For finding the area of a polygon, divide it into triangles and find the area.
* Just add all. Don't worry about convexity, the cross products will handle it.(They can be positive or negative)
* Area = abs(ABC + ACD + ADE + ... - (the last one subtracted))
