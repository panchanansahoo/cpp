====== 1. STL - Data Structures ======
Created Sunday 03 May 2020

* STL - Standard Template Library
Why do we use it? - It is stupid to implement data structures in a contest.

* STL consists of a library having many commonly used algorithms and data structures, implemented.
* There are many things inside STL, in a contest, so we'll just use [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/Main_Page|CPP Reference]] if require somethimg rare, no need to remember anything.
--------------------
It is something that can be done in order to make the thing go fast. It is present. I am there to work on the project.
It is expected to be completed by two-third in the time being, it is estimated that we cannot do well until prodded. What appears to be a great feeling is that which should be kept in order to make way for the things at hand. I can definitely not make it this way.
