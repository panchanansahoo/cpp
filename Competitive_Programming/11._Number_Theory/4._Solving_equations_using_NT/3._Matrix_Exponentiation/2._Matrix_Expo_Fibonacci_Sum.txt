====== 2. Matrix Expo Fibonacci Sum ======
Created Sunday 02 August 2020

* Given m, n. Find fib(m)+fib(m+1)+...+fib(n)
* Find the first two - logn, then add them. O(m) Not Accepted.
* If we algebra, we can see that sum from start to nth, S(n) = F(n+2)-1
* We need S(m)-S(n-1) = which is log(m)+log(n+1). Accepted

Bring any problem down to fibonacci, which is always solvable in f(n)
