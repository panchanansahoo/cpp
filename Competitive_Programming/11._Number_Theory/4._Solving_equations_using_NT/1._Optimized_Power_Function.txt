====== 1. Optimized Power Function ======
Created Saturday 01 August 2020

* Naive solution: for loop, O(n)
* But the solution is symmetric, so their's heterogeneous repetition of work.
* But we can work in squares(symmetry is minimum of 2).

x^{8} = ((x^{2})^{2})^{2} 3 multiplications, instead of 8
x^{9} = x*x^{8} 4 multiplications
