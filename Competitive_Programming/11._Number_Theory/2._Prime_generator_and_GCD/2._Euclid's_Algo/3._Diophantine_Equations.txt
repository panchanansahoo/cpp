====== 3. Diophantine Equations ======
Created Wednesday 29 July 2020

Diohphantine Equations - These are polynomial equations for which integral solutions exist.
--------------------
We need to study only about linear Diophantine equations.
* {{./equation.png?type=equation}}
* Solutions(integral) exist for this if gcd(a,b) is a factor of C.
* We are not going to prove this, but the intuition is easy:
	a. gcd(a,b) is a factor of a, b
	b. gcd(a, b) will divide ax+by
	c. We represent this by c.
e.g {{./equation001.png?type=equation}} has solutions, while {{./equation002.png?type=equation}} has no integral solutions.
* We are studying this in order to apply extended Euclidean algorithm.
