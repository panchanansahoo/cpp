====== 3. Multiplicative Modulo Inverse ======
Created Wednesday 29 July 2020

Multiplicative Inverse: For **a**!=0, multiplicative inverse is 1/a

Multiplicative Modulo Inverse: For **a**, multiplicative inverse **under** m is a number **b** such that (a*b)mod(m)=1
a.b + mQ = 1. Both a, m need to be coprime.
* b is calcuated using extended Euclid algorithm.
