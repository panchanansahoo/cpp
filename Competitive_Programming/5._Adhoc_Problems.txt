====== 5. Adhoc Problems ======
Created Monday 22 June 2020

* These are problems we reduce the given constraints to something fundamental, and not all of the information, operations are used in their full form.
* In other words - using some of the choices is better than using all choices.
* In these problems a specific method does the job, and generalization is not really required.
